Most AI assistants require you to send your data to the cloud. Nova is built on a simple, powerful idea: **your AI should work for you, on your hardware, under your control.**

Nova is an open-source AI secretary that runs entirely on-premise. It brings the power of a dedicated assistant to your workflow while guaranteeing that your data remains private. Period.

## How Nova Works

Nova acts as a true secretary, with privacy as its most important duty.

*   üîí **Private & On-Premise:** This is Nova's core promise. Run it on your own servers. Your data, conversations, and models never leave your infrastructure.
*   üëÄ **Transparent & Autonomous:** Nova manages its own task list on a kanban board. You can watch it work, provide guidance, and have the final say, offering the perfect blend of autonomy and control.
*   üß† **Remembers & Improves:** With a persistent graph memory, Nova learns from your interactions. If it lacks a skill, it can request a new tool from its developers, creating a foundation for continuous improvement.
*   üîå **Adaptable Skills:** While it comes with core secretarial skills (task management, email processing), Nova can be extended with new abilities via MCPs to fit your specific needs.
