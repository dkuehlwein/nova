## Testing Standards

1. **Unit tests** for all business logic
2. **Integration tests** for end-to-end flows
3. **Tests go in** `tests/backend/X`, `tests/frontend/X`, or `tests/` for integration

# Backend tests
Use pytest for python tests.
Run tests with uv from the backend dir. E.g. "backend/uv run pytest ../tests"
