# Code Review and Improvement Suggestions

This document outlines the top 5 code improvement suggestions based on a review of the Nova project's codebase.

## 1. Consolidate API Endpoint Logic

*   **Observation:** There is some duplication of logic between the agent tools (`task_tools.py`) and the API endpoints (`api_endpoints.py`). For example, the `create_task_tool` re-implements some of the logic that is already in the `create_task` API endpoint.
*   **Suggestion:** Refactor the agent tools to call the API endpoints directly, rather than interacting with the database themselves. This would reduce code duplication and ensure that the agent and the UI are always using the same business logic.
*   **Benefit:** This would make the codebase easier to maintain and reduce the risk of inconsistencies between the agent and the UI.

## 2. Centralize State Management on the Frontend

*   **Observation:** The frontend uses a combination of custom hooks and component-level state to manage the application's state. While this works, it can lead to inconsistencies and make it difficult to share state between different parts of the application.
*   **Suggestion:** Introduce a centralized state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit. This would provide a single source of truth for the application's state and make it easier to manage complex state interactions.
*   **Benefit:** This would make the frontend code more predictable, easier to debug, and more scalable.

## 3. Improve Error Handling in the Frontend

*   **Observation:** The frontend's error handling is inconsistent. Some components have robust error handling, while others have minimal or no error handling.
*   **Suggestion:** Implement a consistent error handling strategy across the entire frontend. This could include using a global error boundary to catch unhandled errors, displaying user-friendly error messages, and providing a way for users to report errors.
*   **Benefit:** This would improve the user experience and make it easier to identify and fix bugs.

## 4. Add More Comprehensive Frontend Tests

*   **Observation:** The frontend has minimal testing. While the backend has a good set of unit and integration tests, the frontend is largely untested.
*   **Suggestion:** Add a comprehensive suite of tests to the frontend, including unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the main application flows. Tools like Jest and React Testing Library could be used for this.
*   **Benefit:** This would improve the quality and reliability of the frontend and make it easier to refactor the code without introducing regressions.

## 5. Refactor Large Frontend Components

*   **Observation:** Some of the frontend components, like `chat/page.tsx` and `kanban/page.tsx`, are very large and complex. This makes them difficult to read, understand, and maintain.
*   **Suggestion:** Refactor these large components into smaller, more manageable components. Each smaller component should have a single responsibility, which would make it easier to test and reuse.
*   **Benefit:** This would improve the readability and maintainability of the frontend code and make it easier to add new features in the future.

## Nova Team Responses (June 6 2025)

1. **Consolidate API Endpoint Logic**
   * **Decision:** We agree that some duplication exists. However, having agent tools call HTTP endpoints would add unnecessary overhead and blur service boundaries. Instead, we will introduce a shared service layer inside `backend/service/` that both API endpoints and agent tools can import **after** the remaining core pieces (memory & e-mail monitoring) are in place. This will ensure the service layer design fits real requirements.
   * **Status:** Deferred until post-core milestone (memory + email monitoring).

2. **Centralize State Management on the Frontend**
   * **Observation:** The frontend uses a combination of custom hooks and component-level state to manage the application's state. While this works, it can lead to inconsistencies and make it difficult to share state between different parts of the application.
   * **Suggestion:** Introduce a centralized state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit. This would provide a single source of truth for the application's state and make it easier to manage complex state interactions.
   * **Benefit:** This would make the frontend code more predictable, easier to debug, and more scalable.
   * **Decision:** Our current mix of TanStack Query (server state) and lightweight React context hooks (UI state) is working well for the MVP. Adding Redux Toolkit or Zustand now would increase complexity without clear benefit. We will revisit when client-side state grows beyond current scope.
   * **Status:** No immediate action; monitor complexity.

3. **Improve Error Handling in the Frontend**
   * **Observation:** The frontend's error handling is inconsistent. Some components have robust error handling, while others have minimal or no error handling.
   * **Suggestion:** Implement a consistent error handling strategy across the entire frontend. This could include using a global error boundary to catch unhandled errors, displaying user-friendly error messages, and providing a way for users to report errors.
   * **Benefit:** This would improve the user experience and make it easier to identify and fix bugs.
   * **Decision:** Agreed. We will add a global error boundary, standardized error toast utilities, and ensure all data-fetching hooks surface typed errors.
   * **Status:** Added to frontend backlog.

4. **Add More Comprehensive Frontend Tests**
   * **Decision:** Per Daniel's directive, we will not add automated frontend tests at this stage. We'll rely on manual QA and Storybook until the UI stabilises and core features are complete.
   * **Status:** Deferred.

5. **Refactor Large Frontend Components**
   * **Observation:** Some of the frontend components, like `chat/page.tsx` and `kanban/page.tsx`, are very large and complex. This makes them difficult to read, understand, and maintain.
   * **Suggestion:** Refactor these large components into smaller, more manageable components. Each smaller component should have a single responsibility, which would make it easier to test and reuse.
   * **Benefit:** This would improve the readability and maintainability of the frontend code and make it easier to add new features in the future.
   * **Decision:** Agree. We are already splitting `chat/page.tsx` into smaller components (see PR #123) and will do the same for `kanban/page.tsx` next.
   * **Status:** Ongoing.
