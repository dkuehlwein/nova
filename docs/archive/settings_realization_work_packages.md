# Nova Settings & Real-time Status – Implementation Roadmap

This document breaks the **Settings re-work and real-time plumbing** into small, self-contained work packages (WPs). Each WP is written so you can hand it directly to an AI coding assistant. 

👉 **Mandatory reminder for every WP:** *Search Context7 (use the `resolve-library-id` + `get-library-docs` tools) for the latest patterns before coding – especially for FastAPI background tasks, Redis async pubsub, TanStack Query, and Next app-router.*

⚠️  **Redis Setup Note:** First install Redis locally without Docker (`sudo apt install redis-server` on Ubuntu) due to current ARM/WSL/Docker compatibility issues. This is a temporary workaround.

---

## 0  Context Recap

* **Frontend**: Next 14 (app router, TS), shadcn-UI, TanStack Query not yet installed.
* **Backend**: FastAPI services `start_website.py` (chat agent) and `start_core_agent.py` plus various MCP servers – each already has a `/health` endpoint.
* **New architecture decisions**
  * MCP servers are defined in `configs/mcp_servers.yaml` (file-based, hot-reload)
  * The system prompt lives in `backend/agent/prompts/NOVA_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`
  * Redis (new service) provides pub/sub; FastAPI pushes events → WebSocket clients
  * Docker-compose is already present; we'll add a restart endpoint that shells out to `docker-compose restart <service>` (dev-only convenience)
**Tests**:
Test go under 
- tests/backend/X for backend tests for module X 
- tests/frontend/X for frondend tests for part X
- tests for integration tests.

## ✅ **REAL-TIME SYSTEM STATUS**

**🚀 LIVE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED:**
The Nova real-time system is now fully operational! Changes to the system prompt automatically propagate to all connected frontend clients within 500ms.

**Architecture:**
```
File Change → PromptLoader → Redis Pub/Sub → WebSocket Broadcast → Frontend and Agent Update
```

**Completed Components:**
- ✅ **Hot-reload system**: File watching with debounced updates  
- ✅ **Event bus**: Redis pub/sub for reliable event distribution
- ✅ **Real-time API**: WebSocket endpoints with connection management
- ✅ **Graceful degradation**: System works even without Redis
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Full metrics, health checks, and structured logging

**Available Endpoints:**
- `WS /ws/` - Real-time WebSocket connection
- `GET /ws/connections` - Connection status  
- `GET /ws/metrics` - Real-time metrics
- `POST /ws/broadcast` - Test broadcasting

**Event Types:**
- `prompt_updated` - System prompt changes (✅ implemented)
- `mcp_toggled` - MCP server status changes (pending B5)
- `task_updated` - Task status changes (ready for integration)
- `system_health` - Health status updates (ready for integration)
- `config_validated` - Config validation results (pending B9)

---

## Event Schema Standards

Define consistent event types in `backend/models/events.py`:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Literal, Dict, Any
from datetime import datetime

class NovaEvent(BaseModel):
    id: str  # uuid
    type: Literal["mcp_toggled", "prompt_updated", "task_updated", "system_health", "config_validated"]
    timestamp: datetime
    data: Dict[str, Any]
    source: str  # service name

# WebSocket message format
class WebSocketMessage(BaseModel):
    id: str
    type: str
    timestamp: str  # ISO format
    data: Dict[str, Any]
    source: str
```

## Backend work packages

### **B1  Create YAML config for MCP servers** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Goal**  Replace hard-coded list in `config.py` with a reloadable YAML.

1. ✅ Create directory `configs/` (if absent) and file `mcp_servers.yaml` seeded with:
   ```yaml
   gmail:
     url: http://localhost:8002/mcp
     health_url: http://localhost:8002/health
     description: Gmail MCP Server for email operations
     enabled: true
   ```
2. ✅ Add `pyyaml` and `watchdog` to backend deps (edit `pyproject.toml`).
3. ✅ In `backend/config.py`:
   * Load YAML in `load_mcp_yaml()` returning a `Dict[str, Any]`.
   * Expose a property `MCP_SERVERS` that filters only `enabled: true` entries.
4. ✅ **Hot-reload with debouncing**: start a watchdog observer (`watchdog[watchmedo]`) that listens for `mcp_servers.yaml` changes with 500ms debouncing to avoid race conditions and invalidates an in-memory cache (simple global `LOAD_TS`).

*Acceptance criteria*
* ✅ A unit test toggles `enabled:` flag and asserts the property changes after reload.
* ✅ Multiple rapid file changes only trigger one reload event.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created `configs/mcp_servers.yaml` with initial Gmail server configuration

## Frontend work packages

### **F1  Add TanStack Query & WebSocket hook**

1. `npm i @tanstack/react-query react-use-websocket`
2. Create `src/lib/queryClient.ts` and wrap `<QueryClientProvider>` in `app/(root)/layout.tsx`.
3. Implement `useNovaWebSocket()` that connects to `/ws`, decodes JSON using the `WebSocketMessage` schema, and dispatches to `queryClient.setQueryData()`.

### **F2  Live MCP & Health panels**

* Convert mocks in `settings/page.tsx` to real queries (`useQuery("mcp-servers", fetcher)` with staleTime 0).
* Switch toggles call `mutation(toggleMcp)`; optimistic update → server reply via WS.
* Health overview grid subscribes to `system_health` events.

### **F3  Navbar real-time counters**

* Currently shows static task counts; subscribe to `task_updated` WS events and update cache.
* Check if the Nav bar does not use a get request to update. Either way, we need to change this to the websocket. 
* Change the "operational" from the Navbar to a new endpoints that summarizes the overall system health.
* remove the system status from the landing page - this is redundant to the settings.

---

## Dev-Ops work packages

### **D1  Extend docker-compose**

* Add `redis:` service. Mount data volume if desired.
* Expose `/var/run/docker.sock` to backend container so restart endpoint works (`volumes: ["/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"]`).

### **D2  Docs & onboarding**

* Update rules in .cursor/rules with:
  * How to add new MCP servers via YAML.
  * How hot-reload works.
  * How to use restart endpoint (dev-only).
  * Logging standards and observability endpoints. -> This is partially already done in implementation.mdc

---

## Done when
* Changing `enabled:` in YAML or saving the prompt file instantly propagates to the UI without page reload and to the chat and core agents.
* Settings page shows real server list & can toggle them.
* Navbar numbers update live when core-agent processes tasks.
* `docker-compose restart mcp_gmail` can be triggered from the UI and reflected back in health status.
* All configuration changes are logged with structured data.
* Invalid configurations are prevented with clear validation feedback.
* Integration tests verify end-to-end real-time flows.

Happy building! Remember: **always** pull the freshest examples from Context7 first. 💪
