# Nova AI Assistant: Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
To develop a sophisticated, AI-driven assistant specifically designed to aid managers in their daily tasks and decision-making processes. The project emphasizes a modular architecture to ensure flexibility and scalability.

## Problems It Solves âœ… **ACTIVELY SOLVING**
This assistant addresses common managerial challenges:
- âœ… **Efficient task tracking and management** - Operational via Kanban MCP Server with 10 comprehensive tools
- âœ… **Streamlined communication** - Operational via Gmail MCP Server with 27 email management tools  
- âœ… **AI-powered insights and automation** - Operational via 37-tool agent with natural language interface
- âœ… **Reduced cognitive load** - Centralized 37 tools accessible through conversational AI

## How It Works âœ… **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **âœ… Core Agent** (Gemini 2.5 Pro + LangGraph) serves as the central brain, orchestrating 37 tools across multiple MCP servers
- **âœ… MCP Servers** provide specialized services:
  - Gmail MCP Server (Port 8001): 27 email management tools
  - Kanban MCP Server (Port 8003): 10 task management tools  
  - Future: mem0, calendar, document management servers
- **âœ… FastMCP Framework** enables seamless communication with zero schema compatibility issues
- **âœ… Modular Architecture** with clean backend/frontend separation:
  ```
  mcp_servers/kanban/
  â”œâ”€â”€ backend/          # Python FastMCP server
  â””â”€â”€ frontend/         # UI components (ready for development)
  ```
- **ðŸ”„ User Interface** ready for development with separated frontend components

## User Experience Goals âœ… **ACHIEVED & READY**
- **âœ… Intuitive and Efficient**: Natural language interface allows users to manage tasks and emails conversationally
- **âœ… Seamless Integration**: 37 tools work together through unified agent interface
- **âœ… AI-Powered Assistance**: Agent can create tasks, send emails, organize workflows via simple chat commands
- **âœ… Reliable and Performant**: Zero critical issues, continuous multi-query operation, comprehensive health monitoring
- **ðŸ”„ Personalized and Context-Aware**: Ready for mem0 integration (architecture supports future memory servers)

## Current Operational Capabilities âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**
