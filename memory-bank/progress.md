# Nova AI Assistant: Progress

## Current Status
- **Project Initialization Phase Complete:** The foundational monorepo structure, basic backend configuration, and initial agent test setup are complete.
- **Working Agent Test:** A basic agent (`backend/src/nova/agent/agent.py`) can successfully initialize a Gemini LLM and connect to an example GMail MCP server. It can receive a response but further interaction debugging is needed.
- **`.env` Configuration:** Environment variable loading via a root `.env` file and Pydantic `Settings` is functional.
- **`uv` Environment Management:** A script (`scripts/setup_uv_envs.sh`) is available to automate `uv` virtual environment creation and dependency installation for Python projects.

## What Works
- **Monorepo Structure:** Core directories and essential configuration files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, main `README.md`, placeholder `pyproject.toml` files for backend and MCP servers) are in place.
- **Backend Configuration (`backend/src/nova/config.py`):** Successfully loads settings from a root `.env` file (e.g., API keys, model names).
- **Basic Agent (`backend/src/nova/agent/agent.py`):**
    - Initializes `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (Gemini) using API key and model name from settings.
    - Initializes `MultiServerMCPClient` to connect to a specified MCP server (currently the GMail MCP server).
    - Fetches tools from the connected MCP server.
    - Creates a LangGraph ReAct agent with the LLM and fetched tools.
    - Can invoke the agent with user queries.
- **Example GMail MCP Server:** An existing GMail MCP server is operational and used for the agent tests.

## What's Left to Build
- **LangSmith Integration:** Crucial for debugging and observing agent-MCP interactions.
- **Refined Agent-MCP Interaction Logic:** Debug and enhance the agent's ability to correctly use tools exposed by MCP servers (starting with GMail MCP).
- **`tasks_md_mcp_server`:** Full implementation.
- **Other Core MCP Servers:** `mem0_mcp_server`, `email_mcp_server` (beyond current GMail example, if more generic functionality is needed), `messaging_mcp_server`.
- **Backend Core Development:**
    - FastAPI application setup (API Gateway with routers, WebSocket manager).
    - Celery integration for task orchestration (define tasks, worker setup).
- **Frontend Development:**
    - Selection of a frontend framework.
    - Implementation of Kanban view and Chat/Collaboration UI (Open Canvas exploration).
- **Infrastructure:**
    - Dockerfiles for all services (backend, MCPs).
    - `docker-compose.yml` for local multi-container development.
    - Centralized logging solution selection and setup.
- **Documentation:** ADRs for significant architectural/technical decisions, more detailed component guides.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive E2E tests, unit/integration tests for backend and MCP components.

## Known Issues
- **Agent-MCP Tool Usage:** While the agent can connect and fetch tools, the actual successful invocation and result processing of specific MCP tools (like the GMail draft creation) still needs debugging and refinement. LangSmith will be key here.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Conception:** Based on "Nova AI Assistant: Architecture, Structure, and Tools (v3)".
- **Package Management:** `uv` confirmed.
- **Backend Package Naming:** `nova` chosen 
- **`.env` File Path:** Standardized to project root for Pydantic settings.
- **`MultiServerMCPClient` Cleanup:** Determined that an explicit `client.close()` is likely not needed/available for the main client object; cleanup seems to be managed internally or via specific sessions.
- **Agent Library:** Using `langchain-mcp-adapters` for `MultiServerMCPClient` and `langgraph` for agent creation.

## Current Status (Project Initialization)
- The project "Nova AI Assistant: Architecture, Structure, and Tools" has been initiated.
- The core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created with initial content derived from the project description.
- The foundational monorepo directory structure is currently being established.

## What Works
- N/A (New project - no functional components yet).

## What's Left to Build
- **Everything.** Key areas include:
    - Full monorepo file structure population (e.g., placeholder files, initial configs).
    - Setup of `uv` virtual environments for all Python projects.
    - **Backend Core Development:**
        - FastAPI application setup (API Gateway).
        - Celery integration for task orchestration.
        - Core Agent Executor implementation (Gemini LLM, LangChain/LlamaIndex, `fastmcp` client).
    - **MCP Server Development:**
        - `Tasks.md MCP Server`.
        - `Mem0 MCP Server`.
        - `Email MCP Server`.
        - `Messaging MCP Server`.
        - (Exploratory) `OpenCanvas Backend MCP Server`.
    - **Frontend Development:**
        - Selection of a frontend framework (e.g., React/Vue).
        - Kanban view for `tasks.md`.
        - Chat & Collaboration interface (integrating Open Canvas components).
    - **Infrastructure:**
        - Dockerfiles for all services.
        - `docker-compose.yml` for local development.
        - Centralized logging setup.
    - **Documentation:** ADRs, detailed guides.
    - **Testing:** E2E tests, unit/integration tests for components.

## Known Issues
- N/A (New project).

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Conception:** The project is based on the "Nova AI Assistant: Architecture, Structure, and Tools (v3)" document, which outlines a modular, AI-first assistant.
- **Package Management:** `uv` was chosen from the outset for Python projects due to its speed and modern features.
