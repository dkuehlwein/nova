# Nova AI Assistant: Progress

## Current Status (Project Initialization)
- The project "Nova AI Assistant: Architecture, Structure, and Tools (v3)" has been initiated.
- The core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created with initial content derived from the project description.
- The foundational monorepo directory structure is currently being established.

## What Works
- N/A (New project - no functional components yet).

## What's Left to Build
- **Everything.** Key areas include:
    - Full monorepo file structure population (e.g., placeholder files, initial configs).
    - Setup of `uv` virtual environments for all Python projects.
    - **Backend Core Development:**
        - FastAPI application setup (API Gateway).
        - Celery integration for task orchestration.
        - Core Agent Executor implementation (Gemini LLM, LangChain/LlamaIndex, `fastmcp` client).
    - **MCP Server Development:**
        - `Tasks.md MCP Server`.
        - `Mem0 MCP Server`.
        - `Email MCP Server`.
        - `Messaging MCP Server`.
        - (Exploratory) `OpenCanvas Backend MCP Server`.
    - **Frontend Development:**
        - Selection of a frontend framework (e.g., React/Vue).
        - Kanban view for `tasks.md`.
        - Chat & Collaboration interface (integrating Open Canvas components).
    - **Infrastructure:**
        - Dockerfiles for all services.
        - `docker-compose.yml` for local development.
        - Centralized logging setup.
    - **Documentation:** ADRs, detailed guides.
    - **Testing:** E2E tests, unit/integration tests for components.

## Known Issues
- N/A (New project).

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Conception:** The project is based on the "Nova AI Assistant: Architecture, Structure, and Tools (v3)" document, which outlines a modular, AI-first assistant.
- **Package Management:** `uv` was chosen from the outset for Python projects due to its speed and modern features.
- **Backend Package Naming:** `backend/src/nova/` was refined to `backend/src/nova_backend/` for improved clarity and to avoid potential namespace collisions within the monorepo.
- (This section will be updated as the project progresses and decisions evolve.)
