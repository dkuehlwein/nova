# Nova AI Assistant: Progress

## Current Status
- **Core Agent Capabilities Enhanced:** The agent now successfully integrates with LangSmith for tracing and can reliably use tools from the GMail MCP server.
- **Configuration Robustness:** Backend configuration (`config.py`) updated to include LangSmith settings and corrected `.env` path.
- **GMail MCP Server Stability:** Resolved critical `AttributeError` bugs in the GMail MCP server, ensuring its tools are correctly invoked by the `GmailService` methods.

## What Works
- **Monorepo Structure:** Core directories and essential configuration files are in place.
- **Backend Configuration (`backend/src/nova/config.py`):**
    - Successfully loads settings from a root `.env` file (API keys, model names, LangSmith config).
    - `Settings` class includes fields for LangSmith (`USE_LANGSMITH`, `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`, `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT`, `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT`).
- **Core Agent (`backend/src/nova/agent/agent.py`):**
    - Initializes `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (Gemini).
    - Initializes `MultiServerMCPClient` for MCP server communication.
    - Fetches tools from connected MCP servers.
    - Creates a LangGraph ReAct agent.
    - **LangSmith Integration:** Successfully configures and uses LangSmith for tracing if `USE_LANGSMITH` is true, by setting the required environment variables.
    - Can invoke the agent with user queries, and interactions with MCP tools are traced in LangSmith.
- **Example GMail MCP Server (`mcp_servers/gmail/main.py`):**
    - Operational and its tools (e.g., `create_draft_email`) are now correctly implemented and callable by the agent after fixing `AttributeError` bugs. The tool definitions now correctly map to the `GmailService` methods.
- **`.env` Configuration:** Environment variable loading via a root `.env` file and Pydantic `Settings` is functional.
- **`uv` Environment Management:** Script for `uv` environment setup is available.

## What's Left to Build
- **Develop `tasks_md_mcp_server`:** Full implementation of the `tasks.md` MCP server.
- **Other Core MCP Servers:** `mem0_mcp_server`, a more generic `email_mcp_server` (if needed beyond current GMail example), `messaging_mcp_server`.
- **Backend Core Development:**
    - FastAPI application setup (API Gateway with routers, WebSocket manager).
    - Celery integration for task orchestration (define tasks, worker setup).
- **Frontend Development:**
    - Selection of a frontend framework.
    - Implementation of Kanban view and Chat/Collaboration UI (Open Canvas exploration).
- **Infrastructure:**
    - Dockerfiles for all services (backend, MCPs).
    - `docker-compose.yml` for local multi-container development.
    - Centralized logging solution selection and setup (beyond LangSmith for application logs).
- **Documentation:** ADRs for significant architectural/technical decisions, more detailed component guides.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive E2E tests, unit/integration tests for backend and MCP components.

## Known Issues
- No major known issues with the recently implemented LangSmith integration or GMail MCP tool usage. Further testing will reveal any new issues.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Conception:** Based on "Nova AI Assistant: Architecture, Structure, and Tools (v3)".
- **Package Management:** `uv` confirmed.
- **Backend Package Naming:** `nova` chosen.
- **`.env` File Path:** Standardized to project root for Pydantic settings; path in `config.py` adjusted to `../../.env`.
- **`MultiServerMCPClient` Cleanup:** Determined that an explicit `client.close()` is likely not needed.
- **Agent Library:** Using `langchain-mcp-adapters` for `MultiServerMCPClient` and `langgraph` for agent creation.
- **Debugging Strategy:** LangSmith adopted as the primary tool for tracing and debugging agent-MCP interactions.
- **GMail MCP Server Implementation:** Refactored tool definitions to correctly call underlying `GmailService` methods, resolving widespread `AttributeError` issues.

## Current Status (Project Initialization)
- The project "Nova AI Assistant: Architecture, Structure, and Tools" has been initiated.
- The core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created with initial content derived from the project description.
- The foundational monorepo directory structure is currently being established.

## What Works
- N/A (New project - no functional components yet).

## What's Left to Build
- **Everything.** Key areas include:
    - Full monorepo file structure population (e.g., placeholder files, initial configs).
    - Setup of `uv` virtual environments for all Python projects.
    - **Backend Core Development:**
        - FastAPI application setup (API Gateway).
        - Celery integration for task orchestration.
        - Core Agent Executor implementation (Gemini LLM, LangChain/LlamaIndex, `fastmcp` client).
    - **MCP Server Development:**
        - `Tasks.md MCP Server`.
        - `Mem0 MCP Server`.
        - `Email MCP Server`.
        - `Messaging MCP Server`.
        - (Exploratory) `OpenCanvas Backend MCP Server`.
    - **Frontend Development:**
        - Selection of a frontend framework (e.g., React/Vue).
        - Kanban view for `tasks.md`.
        - Chat & Collaboration interface (integrating Open Canvas components).
    - **Infrastructure:**
        - Dockerfiles for all services.
        - `docker-compose.yml` for local development.
        - Centralized logging setup.
    - **Documentation:** ADRs, detailed guides.
    - **Testing:** E2E tests, unit/integration tests for components.

## Known Issues
- N/A (New project).

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Conception:** The project is based on the "Nova AI Assistant: Architecture, Structure, and Tools (v3)" document, which outlines a modular, AI-first assistant.
- **Package Management:** `uv` was chosen from the outset for Python projects due to its speed and modern features.
