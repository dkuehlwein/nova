# Nova AI Assistant: Project Brief (v3)

## Project Name
Nova AI Assistant: Architecture, Structure, and Tools (v3)

## Philosophy
A modular, AI-first assistant for managers, leveraging independently deployable MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for diverse functionalities. The core agent orchestrates these tools. User interaction for tasks is managed via a `tasks.md` application, and chat/document collaboration will explore Open Canvas.

## Core Requirements and Goals
- **Modular Design:** Implement functionality through independently deployable MCP servers.
- **AI-First Assistant for Managers:** Provide intelligent assistance tailored to managerial tasks.
- **Task Management:** Utilize `tasks.md` for managing tasks, accessible via an MCP server.
- **Chat & Document Collaboration:** Explore and integrate Open Canvas for collaborative features.
- **Python & `uv`:** Use Python for backend and MCP server development, with `uv` for package and virtual environment management.
