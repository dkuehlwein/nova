#
# Option 1: Direct credentials (convenient for local dev)
#   lam_username: "your-username"
#   lam_password: "your-password"
#   gitlab_token: "glpat-xxxxx"
#
# Option 2: Environment variable names (more secure for production)
#   lam_username_env: "LAM_USERNAME"  # reads from os.environ["LAM_USERNAME"]
#   lam_password_env: "LAM_PASSWORD"
#   gitlab_token_env: "GITLAB_PERSONAL_TOKEN"

# Apache proxy. Both LAM credentials AND GitLab PAT are required.
