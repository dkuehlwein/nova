The task status will be updated to NEEDS_REVIEW by the core agent when it resumes.

@tool
def ask_user(question: str) -> str:
    """
    Ask the user a question when you need input, decisions, or clarification.
    
    **WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL**:
    - Task contains "ask user" or "get user input" - use this tool
    - Task requires user decision, approval, or clarification
    - Task involves notifying user of important information
    - You need user input to proceed with the task
    
    This will pause the current task and wait for user response.
    The core agent will automatically move the task to NEEDS_REVIEW status
    when this tool is called, and back to USER_INPUT_RECEIVED when resumed.
    
    Args:
        question: Your question for the user. Provide sufficient context 
                 since this will be the message they see in the task chat.
                 
                 Examples:
                 - "Should I send this email draft to the client? [email content]"
                 - "I need approval to book the McKittrick Hotel for $200/night"
                 - "This task requires clarification: should I prioritize speed or accuracy?"
    
    Returns:
        The user's response from the chat interface
